# PyMUSAS

PYthon Multilingual Ucrel Semantic Analysis System, it currently is a rule based token level semantic tagger which can be added to any spaCy pipeline. The current tagger system is flexible enough to support any semantic tagset, however the tagset we have concentrated on and give examples for throughout is the [Ucrel Semantic Analysis System (USAS)](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/). 

In the future we hope to expand the documentation so that we can cover more languages, support Multi Word Expressions (MWE), and incorporate vector based methods. All of these future plans can be seen in more detail in our project road map (project road map currently under development).
