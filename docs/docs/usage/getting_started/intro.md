# PyMUSAS

**Py**thon **M**ultilingual **U**crel **S**emantic **A**nalysis **S**ystem, it currently is a rule based token level semantic tagger which can be added to any spaCy pipeline. The current tagger system is flexible enough to support any semantic tagset, however the tagset we have concentrated on and give examples for throughout is the [Ucrel Semantic Analysis System (USAS)](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/).

## Reading the documentation

How the documentation website is split between the Usage and API pages:

* [Usage](/) - The usage pages contain both tutorials and how-to-guides.
* [API](/api/spacy_api/taggers/rule_based) - Are the docstrings of the PyMUSAS library, best pages to look at if you want to know exactly what a class / function / attribute does in more technical detail. These do contain examples, but the examples are more like minimum working examples rather than real world examples.


## Future Plans

In the future we hope to expand the documentation so that we can cover more languages, support Multi Word Expressions (MWE), and incorporate vector based methods. All of these future plans can be seen in more detail in our project road map (project road map currently under development).
